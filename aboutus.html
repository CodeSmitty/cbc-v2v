            <h1>Veteran to Veteran</h1>
            <p>
                Vet to Vet &reg; was founded in 1994.  Just before Christmas of that year, Jess and Peggy Johnson reached out to local disabled veterans to distribute hamburgers and coffee thermoses to 24 patients at the Dallas VA Hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
                This generosity was warly received by the Veterans and the effort a great success.  The Johnson's soon realized they lacked additional supplies to provide gifts to each of the hundreds of patients they discovered were housed in transitional car unit.  With this, they returned the next day with gifts and support for all of them!  In the years since, they have expanded their operation to include Bonham, Waco, Temple, and Dallas VA hospitals.

                Vet to Vet &reg; now provides 4,000 gifts to over 1,600 patients each Holiday Season, as well as hosting events, bingo games and barbecues throughout the year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vet to Vet &reg; hosts fundraisers that support Texas VA hospitals and plan to open Chapters in all 162 VA hospitals across the country.

            <p>
